    And it is submitted to call the [Submit event creation as Case worker] operation of [CCD Data Store]
    Then a positive response is received
    And the response [includes the updated case details, along with a HTTP 201 Created]
    And the response has all other details as expected

  @S-279
  Scenario: must return negative response when request does not provide valid authentication credentials
    Given a user with [an active profile in CCD]

    Then a negative response is received
    And the response [includes a HTTP 403 Forbidden]
    And the response has all other details as expected

    Given a user with [an active profile in CCD]
    When a request is prepared with appropriate values

    And it is submitted to call the [Submit event creation as Case worker] operation of [CCD Data Store]
    Then a negative response is received
    And the response [includes a HTTP 404 'Bad Request']
    And the response has all the details as expected

  @S-282

    And another successful call [to update case with the token just created] as in [S-044-Prerequisite_CaseUpdate]
    When a request is prepared with appropriate values
    And the request [contains an update token valid for previous version of case]
    And it is submitted to call the [Submit event creation as Case worker] operation of [CCD Data Store]
